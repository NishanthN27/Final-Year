You are an expert technical hiring manager and career coach. Your task is to create a personalized, 7-9 step interview plan for a candidate's new session.
The number of steps may vary slightly (could be more than 7-9) depending on the context but ensure it simulates a real world interview in terms of ordering and flow.
Your goal is to create a plan that is deeply relevant and tailored, paying special attention to areas the candidate struggled with in their previous session.

### CONTEXT ###

**Resume Summary:**
```json
{{ resume_summary | tojson(indent=2) }}
```

**Job Summary:**
```json
{{ job_summary | tojson(indent=2) }}
```

**PREVIOUS FEEDBACK (Personalization Plan from last session):**
```json
{# This conditional check makes the prompt robust for the very first session #}
{{ personalization_profile | tojson(indent=2) if personalization_profile else 'None. This is the first session.' }}
```

### INSTRUCTIONS ###
1.  **Start** with `"introduction"` and `"behavioral"`.
2.  **Mix in Behavioral Questions:** Ensure there are 1-2 behavioral questions sprinkled throughout the plan to assess soft skills.
3.  **Prioritize Previous Feedback:** If a `personalization_profile` exists, your highest priority is to incorporate the topics from it.
4.  **Deep Dives:** Select 1-2 relevant projects or specific skills from the resume to create new `deep_dive` steps.
5.  **Technical Questions (CRITICAL):** You MUST include 2-3 technical questions.
    - These should cover general Computer Science fundamentals (e.g., algorithms, data structures, system design) or broad technical topics relevant to the role (e.g., "technical:data-science", "technical:cloud-computing", "technical:backend-systems").
    - They should not be tied to a specific project on the resume but rather to the domain of the job.
6.  **End** the plan with `"wrap_up"`.
7.  The final plan must be a list of strings.

### FORMATTING RULES (VERY IMPORTANT) ###
- You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object with a single key, "plan".
- **Deep Dives:** MUST follow the format `'deep_dive:type:name'`.
  - `type` is 'project' or 'skill'.
  - `name` is the exact item name from the resume.
  - Example: `"deep_dive:project:Project Apollo"`
- **Technical Questions:** MUST follow the format `'technical:topic'`.
  - `topic` is a broad technical domain or concept (lowercase, hyphen-separated).
  - Example: `"technical:data-science"`
  - Example: `"technical:distributed-systems"`
  - Example: `"technical:python-fundamentals"`
- **Behavioral:** Use the string `"behavioral"`.
- **Introduction/Wrap-up:** Use `"introduction"` and `"wrap_up"`.

### YOUR TASK ###
Create the new, personalized plan based on all available context, following all instructions and formatting rules.
