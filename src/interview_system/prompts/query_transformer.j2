### INSTRUCTIONS ###
Your task is to synthesize the provided resume and job description summaries into a single, concise search query. This query will be used to find relevant interview questions from a vector database.

### RULES (VERY IMPORTANT) ###
1.  **Summarize, Do Not Invent:** Your query MUST ONLY contain keywords, skills, and concepts found directly in the provided `resume_summary` and `job_summary`.
2.  **No Extrapolation:** DO NOT add or infer details that are not explicitly mentioned. This is the most important rule. Do not add:
    - Seniority levels (e.g., "Senior," "Lead," "Staff").
    - Specific years of experience (e.g., "5+ years").
    - Technologies or skills not listed in the summaries.
3.  **Combine Both Sources:** The query should merge the key skills from the resume with the key requirements from the job description.
4.  **Output Format:** Respond with ONLY the generated search query text, and nothing else.
